    The dict also includes any metadata or logs associated with the job.

    Returns None instead of a dict if there's no job with the given job_id.

    The keys of a job dict are:

    "job_id": The unique identifier for the job (unicode)

    "job_type": The name of the job function that will be executed for this
        job (unicode)

    "status": The current status of the job, e.g. "pending", "complete", or
        "error" (unicode)

    "data": Any output data returned by the job if it has completed
        successfully. This may be any JSON-serializable type, e.g. None, a
        string, a dict, etc.

    "error": If the job failed with an error this will be a dict with a
        "message" key whose value is a string error message. The dict may also
        have other keys specific to the particular type of error. If the job
        did not fail with an error then "error" will be None.

    "requested_timestamp": The time at which the job was requested (string)

    "finished_timestamp": The time at which the job finished (string)

    "sent_data": The input data for the job, provided by the client site.
        This may be any JSON-serializable type, e.g. None, a string, a dict,
        etc.

    "result_url": The callback URL that CKAN Service Provider will post the
        result to when the job finishes (unicode)

    "api_key": The API key that CKAN Service Provider will use when posting
        the job result to the result_url (unicode or None). A None here doesn't
        mean that there was no API key: CKAN Service Provider deletes the API
        key from the database after it has posted the result to the result_url.

    "job_key": The key that users must provide (in the Authorization header of
        the HTTP request) to be authorized to modify the job (unicode).
        For example requests to the CKAN Service Provider API need this to get
        the status or output data of a job or to delete a job.
        If you login to CKAN Service Provider as an administrator then you can
        administer any job without providing its job_key.

    "metadata": Any custom metadata associated with the job (dict)

    "logs": Any logs associated with the job (list)
